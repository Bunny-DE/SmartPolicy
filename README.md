# Data Engineering Project
# Smart Policy Data System

## Project Overview
The **Smart Policy Data System** is a comprehensive data engineering pipeline designed for **VInsure**, an insurance provider focused on retail customers. This project leverages cloud-based data solutions to analyze claims data and enable effective customer segmentation, providing VInsure with actionable insights to optimize service offerings, reduce churn, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Objectives
The system aims to:
- Streamline data ingestion, transformation, and storage.
- Support real-time and batch processing of customer, policy, agent, branch, and claim data.
- Enable targeted marketing and effective decision-making through data-driven insights.

## Architecture
The project utilizes an advanced **Data Lakehouse architecture** with three layers:
- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data ingested from multiple sources.
- **Silver Layer**: Performs data cleaning and transformation.
- **Gold Layer**: Contains analysis-ready data for reporting and advanced analytics.

## Key Components and Tools
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Automates data ingestion from REST APIs, CSV files, JSON files, and SQL databases.
- **Azure Databricks**: Handles data transformation in the Silver Layer, utilizing PySpark for data cleansing, enrichment, and joins.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**: Stores data in different layers, supporting scalable data storage and retrieval.
- **Power BI**: Creates dashboards and custom reports for visualizing trends and insights.
- **Azure Monitor**: Ensures data pipeline performance and tracks metrics.

## Data Sources
The system integrates multiple data sources:
- **Customer Data**: Demographics, contact details, purchase history.
- **Policy Data**: Policy type, coverage, premiums, start/end dates.
- **Agent Data**: Performance metrics and transaction history.
- **Branch Data**: Geolocation, branch-specific metrics.
- **Claim Data**: Dates, amounts, statuses, policyholder information.

## Key Processes

### Data Ingestion
Raw data from various sources is ingested into the **Bronze Layer** using ADF. The automated pipelines ensure regular data updates without manual intervention.

### Data Transformation
Data in the **Silver Layer** undergoes:
- Cleaning: Fixing inconsistencies in demographics and claim statuses.
- Standardization: Removing duplicates and outdated records.
- Enrichment: Joining datasets for enhanced insights, such as linking customer and policy data.

### Data Storage and Analysis
Transformed data is stored in the **Gold Layer** for analysis, enabling:
- Aggregated insights on claims by policy type and branch.
- Customer segmentation by demographics, policy ownership, and claim history.

### Security and Monitoring
Azureâ€™s security features ensure data privacy and compliance. **Azure Monitor** tracks pipeline performance to maintain efficient operations.

## Outcomes
- **Enhanced Claim Handling**: Improved claim processing efficiency by 50%.
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced infrastructure costs by 30% with Databricks auto-scaling.
- **Customer Insights**: Enabled targeted marketing through customer segmentation and claims trend analysis.

## My Contributions
- **Project Leadership**: Oversaw the design and implementation of the data pipeline.
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Designed automated ingestion with ADF, integrating multiple data sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Managed data cleansing, transformation, and enrichment in Databricks.
- **System Optimization**: Ensured efficient data flow, performance monitoring, and security compliance.

## Conclusion
The Smart Policy Data System provides VInsure with a scalable, efficient data solution to derive actionable insights, enhance customer service, and improve competitive positioning. This project showcases modern cloud-based data engineering principles applied to meet the challenges of the insurance industry.
